                    <p>Being the DSC-UMIT lead, I had a wonderful experience! From setting up the club,
                     to making students familiar to it, to organising workshops and seminars, DSC had a 
                     great impact on me. During my tenure as the lead, we conducted various events on C++,
                      Java, Android Development, Google Cloud, Design thinking, etc. DSC focuses on the 
                      importance of community learning which allows students to experience learning in a 
                      more realistic and practical way. To all those looking to help local businesses around you
                       or those looking to change the world, DSC is the platform for you! </p>
